        <p>
            Java is another High level programming language that is based on classes. It is the most popular language when looking at android smartphone
            applications. Instead of compiling straight to machine code and running or going through an interpreter 
            line by line, Java is a little different. Java code compiles to bytecode which is then ran by a Java Virtual Machine.

        <p>
            Java was originally developed in 1995 by James Gosling and has been very popular ever since. Java was originally called Oak but renamed due to 
            trademark reasons. Java's syntax was designed to be easier to use than C++ but still have the same look and feel.
