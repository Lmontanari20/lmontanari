             <h3>There are three main types of programming languages:</h3>
             <ul id="list">
                 <li>Machine Languages</li>
                 <li>Assembly Languages</li>
                 <li>High Level Languages</li>
             </ul>
             <p><strong>Machine Languages</strong> are what the computer actually reads. It consists of a bunch of 0's and 1's. Programming in machine language would consist 
             of memorizing a bunch of binary code which is not ideal.</p> <br />
             <p><strong>Assembly Languages</strong> are the next step up from machine language and can barely be desiphered by humans. It is also unique to a specific machine 
             and needs to be converted to machine code for the computer to read. This is done by an assembler program which is unique for each machine language.</p>
             <br />
             <p><strong>High Level Languages</strong> are the languages that are the most commonly used today. They are more English like so it is easier for the programmer to 
             think in the programming language.Like an assembly language, high level languages need to be translated for the computer to read. The two types
             of translators are compilers and interpreters. Compilers translate the entire source code while interpreters translate one line at a time.</p>
