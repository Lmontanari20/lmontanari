         <h3>What is Python?</h3>
         <p>
             Python is an object oriented high level programming language that requires an interpreter rather than a compiler. Python syntax tries to 
             make the code very easy to read. It also supports modules and packages resulting in a huge variety of programs that can be made.

         <p>
             Python was created in 1989 by Guido van Rossum. Most people think it is a new upcoming language but in reality it is older then Java. It is 
             not named after the snake but after the British Comedy Monty Python's Flying Circus
