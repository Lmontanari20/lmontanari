        <p>
            C++ is a Object Oriented programming language used for general purposes. Since it is derived from C you have the chance to code in C style, or 
            you can use the object oriented style. This makes it a type of hybrid language because you can use features from a low and high level language.

        <h3><a id="bib" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/info/history/">C++ History</a></h3>
        <p>
            The C++ Language was derived from the C language by Bjarne Stroustrup. In the early developement stages he called the language C with classes but 
            eventually came up with C++ due to ++ being the increment operator.
